#   This code generates all (up to some limits) Schubert problems 
# on the given flag manifold.   Changing the procedure Belongs to 
# Single (line 40-45), generates only Grassmannian Schubert problems.
# Later we'll think of a way to generate only Schubert problems with 
# a *few* mixed conditions.
#
#   It writes them to a file raw_problems/FlagManifold, which will be 
# used to create files for input into the database for the monotone secant conjecture

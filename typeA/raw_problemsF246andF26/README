The files in raw_problems contain all Schubert problems on a given flag manifold.

Here is a guide to one

# Here is the list of problems.   Each problem is a triple [string, integer, list].  The string is a compact notation
#  for Grassmannian-Schubert problems.  The number is the number of solutions.  The list is a list of triples indicating
#   the conditions.  Each is [ permutation, multiplicity, symbol ].   It indicates that the Schubert variety given by the 
#   permutation occurs multiplicity-many times.  The symbol is a shorthand for the condition.

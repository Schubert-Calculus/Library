-- TypeAStiefelCoords
------------------------------------
-- Computes Stiefel Coordinates for a Type A Flag Variety (including Grassmannians as a special case)
-- Inputs: k, the dimension of the largest proper subspace in our flag variety (if we want 2 planes in 4 planes in 6 space, k = 4)
--            (do I need to specify the other subspaces instead, or is this enough? If no change, how do I really know based off of
--             alpha which flag variety I'm working in? For example, if k = 4, n = 6, and alpha = {1,2,3,4}, how would I know whether
--             I am in 2 planes in 4 planes in 6 space vs just 4 planes in 6 space, since there are no descents? This shouldn't affect
--             any of the functionality of my code below, but I was just wondering.)
--         n, dimension of the ambient affine space (if we want 2 planes in 4 planes in 6 space, n = 6)
--         alpha, a k element subset of {1,...,n} (descents of alpha imply which flag variety we're working in: 
--                if we want 2 planes in 4 planes in 6 space, alpha_1 < alpha_2 and alpha_3 < alpha_4, but perhaps alpha_2 > alpha_3)
--         S, coefficient ring (for example QQ)
-- Outputs: M, the matrix of Stiefel coordinates
--          R, the ring of variables used in M (right now, actually more variables than that - can fix?)

TypeAStiefelCoords(ZZ,ZZ,List,Ring) := (k,n,alpha,S) -> (
-- Define ring of variables
     R = S[y_(1,1)..y_(n,k)];
-- Define matrix of correct size (and over the correct ring) that we can manipulate
     M = mutableMatrix(R,n,k);
-- Set leading ones in kxk identity submatrix with rows indexed by alpha
     for i from 1 to k do M_(alpha_(i-1)-1,i-1) = 1;
-- Set variables above the leading 1's
     for j from 1 to k do
     for i from 1 to alpha_(j-1)-1 do M_(i-1,j-1) = y_(i,j);
-- Set to 0 all entries below and to the right of leading 1's
     for i from 1 to k do
     for j from i+1 to k do M_(alpha_(i-1)-1,j-1) = 0;
-- Make matrix non-mutable, and return Stiefel coordinates and ring

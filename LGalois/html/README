This stores the completed data for the Lagrangian Grassmannian.
Still need to differentiate it according to Galois groups.

26 December 2024:  Used Blocker 601L to compute 99M more of  421.21.21.1 = 9 (100M total)

The group of order 192 has index 2 in  (S_2)^4 with S^4 acting on it (signed permutations).  It should be 8T39

The three interesting groups of order 8 appear to have 1152, which should be (S_4)^2 with S_2 acting on it


https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~matyd/GroupNames/T15.html   <=== This is missing the group of order 1152 that I found



The one of order 16 is much more confusing



https://hobbes.la.asu.edu/Groups/group-data/d20t267.html  <== the group of order 2880 in S_16   


1508	t16n1508	2880 = 2^6 · 3^2 · 5   Resolvents  3: 3T1   60: 5T4   180: 15T15

Other possibilities:

1328	t16n1328	1920 = 27 · 3 · 5  10T37, 10T38, 20T226, 20T219, 20T218, 20T222, 20T223   2: 2T1  120: 5T5
1329	t16n1329	1920 = 27 · 3 · 5  16T1329, 20T217, 20T221     2: 2T1    120: 5T5

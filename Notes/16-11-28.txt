Bruhat Order on Permutations with a unique descent

Write it up to the descent. Then it's point wise comparison

That is, 1356>1234 since 1>=1, 3>=2, 5>=3 and 6>=4


Making Equations:
--------------------

Input:
Stiefel Coords & a list of {w_i,F_i}

Output:
Ideal 




We should have osculating flag allow two standard rational normal curves (1,t,...,) and (1,t,t^2/2,t^3/3!,....)
Cut the functionality of exporting parametrized osculating flag



Singular has some issues about procedure not being able to change baseRing. 
So in our singular library, it will be necessary (and inelegant) to force the user to 
	make SCring, then define the basering manually as the output of make S.C.ring.

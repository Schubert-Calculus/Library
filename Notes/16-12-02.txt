When is a schubert problem 0-dimensional (for a generic instance)?




Def: w_1...w_s is a schubert problem for  Fl(a.) if and only if 

1) descents of w_i are contained in a.
2(*)) sum(l(w_i)) = dim(a.)
	(*) If user gives Stiefel coordinates S.C. then 
	    dim(a.) = #indeterminants in the ring of S.C.


a=0<a_1<....<a_s=n
dim(a.):=sum(i=1)^(s-1) (a_i-a_(i-1))(a_s-a_i)

codim(X_w(Fl(a.)))=l(w)



---Taylor discuss M2 code--------


Things to do later:
Helper flags
	-Osculating flags
	-Secant flags
	-Random flags
[see older notes file for description of osculating flag. or the .m2 code]

Secant:
t_1,...,t_n
f_i(t):=<gamma(t_1),..,gamma(t_i)>



LIFTING FORMULATION:
---------------------
(you can read in the paper and figure this out, but its hard to make sense of)

Take stieffel coordinates and condition  w and flag F
	add variables & make bilinear equations.
{seriously look at this paper and work out examples in the grassmannian and try to figure out what it would be in other flag varieties}

CREATING SOME FLAGS

-user defined flags
-random flags (if no flag is given, make random flags)

--rational curve and some points

Osculating flags
---------------
gamma(t)=(1,t,t^2,...,t^{n-1})


for any rational curve, you get a symplectic form for free that makes it an isotropic curve

Fl(t)=<gamma(t),gamma'(t),gamma''(t),....,gamma^(n-1)(t)> (the osculating flag of gamma(t))

Fl is isotropic w.r.t. some symplectic form <,> (necessarily n=2m even) 
		<---->
Fl_i(t) is isotropic for i<=n (that is, <,>|_(Fl_i) is identically zero)
		<----->
More concisely, <Fl_{n-i}(t),Fl_{i}(t)>==0

These are the flags you need for Schubert calculus in type c (symplectic)


Its true that if you ahve any rational curve you get a symplectic form.
When gamma(t)=(1,t,t^2/2,t^3/3!,...,t^{n-1}/(n-1)!)

You get


J:=
[0 		  1(anti diagonal)]
[-1(anti diagonal 0		  ]



Now imagine the matrix with 1's directly above the diagonal.
If you exponentiate this you get a polynomial.
The first row is gamma(t) (the subsequent ones shift )
